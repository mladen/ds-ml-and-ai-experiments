## Setting up the environment

Setting up the virtual environment is a good practice to avoid conflicts between libraries. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
deactivate
```
